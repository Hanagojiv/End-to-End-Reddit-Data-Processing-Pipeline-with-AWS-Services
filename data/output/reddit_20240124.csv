19dry3i,What do you think about Apache Pulsar?,"Pulsar is a robust data streaming and messaging platform, similar to Kafka, but with more features out-of-the-box like schema-registry, multi-tenancy, geo-replication, and tiered storage.

It has been an Apache top-level project since 2018 ([https://pulsar.apache.org](https://pulsar.apache.org/)). Many big companies like Tencent, Discord, Flipkart, and Intuit use it.

Unlike Kafka, it processes messages individually, instead of just using offsets. Horizontal scaling is painless in comparison with Kafka, thanks to the separation of compute and storage nodes. Supports millions of topics.

When I first heard about the Pulsar, I thought my dreams had come true. 🌈🦄

Now I'm trying to understand why there is not much buzz in public about it:

* Is it a marketing flaw and people just didn't ever hear about it?
* Or is there something wrong or missing in Pulsar?
* Maybe it is just an overkill for most new projects?

19dtqiu,DBT for On-Prem ETL,"So, to provide some background, I currently run a very small data team in an industry that’s heavily biased towards on-prem. After facing some limitations with SSIS, we’re looking to move to a more modern ETL solution. My issue is we are currently built to run on-prem ETL while modern architecture seems to focus cloud ELT.

My current setup is as follows: 
1. Extract data from a variety of structured SQL servers (most on-prem, some accessed through VPN. All have direct SQL access)
2. Transform that data using SQL into a more usable, de-normalized format
3. Upload the data into our on-prem data warehouse for analytics. 

A few complicating factors:
1. Several of our vendors are moving to the cloud and I’ll need to export the data via API (and one vendor through snowflake)
2. Our largest data table is under 30 million rows, I don’t expect I need anything more complicated than polars/pandas and SQL
3. In the future, we’d like to be able to ingest and process high frequency (~5-15s) data loaded via 1 hour batches. I don’t need streaming yet nor do I want to implement it. 

Tools I’ve considered:
Mage*
Dagster
Airflow
Pandas/Polars*
DuckDB
DBT*
Minio*

*Current favorite for that role


My thought is, if I’m rebuilding this anyway, would it make more sense to move to an ELT architecture with DBT or maintain my ETL architecture with Python/SQL. What would that look like? Load everything raw into parquet files and process from there? Load raw data into intermediate tables on the same server as the data warehouse? If the majority of my data is already structured, should I bother with parquet? I apologize for the deluge of questions, I’m trying to wrap my head around this new world order after spending too long in the comfortable embrace of SSIS.

19dtn2u,How to do design a near real-time data job,"I need to create a python app that will output data e.g. every 5s (ideally should be parametrizable to e.g. 10s or 1 day). Input is realtime data stream from RabbitMQ/Kafka. Every 5s app should look into the queue and take all data between defined start and end time - i.e. every run instance should be idempotent as it is defined by static start/end. Job should have some retrying logic in case something fails. App should run in on-premise Kubernetes cluster.

I thought of 3 possible solutions:

a) custom python app with some scheduler such as Airflow that could schedule the app in cluster every 5s

b) custom python app that would run in an infinite loop as standalone pod in the cluster and every 5s or so would do the job

c) use some existing solution that would solve both issues (data logic and scheduling) for me

The issue with a) is we need a robust scheduler that could handle all the job spawns (each 5s, each 10s etc.)

The issue with b) is there is less transparency in case app crashes and also since its only one app in case it crashes all runs that should run after the crash won't run until the app is fixed (scheduler would schedule all the following runs despite previous fails)

The issue with c) is the only potential solution is Prefect but it has memory leak so when we run it for inifity it will eventually run out of memory.

I said how in my current role, as a Product Engineer, i spend a lot of time with users and going through user data/feedback to determine the success of a feature. 

Now that I'm thinking about it -- they may have been asking me what tools I use.

Earlier, I described a FastAPI poller I built that detected any new data from an AWS EC2 where I dumped everything. Then it took the new data, transformed it in into the ""pretty"" staging structures then updated the appropriate (separate) EC2 tables. In this case, I use pydantic models to ensure that the data is structured correctly. Any issues I can see in the logs. 

Now that time has passed I think they were asking about testing (in dbt) and monitoring tools.

I'd like to move to the West in the near future working now more like in 2d world region. To do this, I think I need to master the appropriate stack (and understand the diff - as-is vs. to-be-done). I tried to make it reading this subreddit (thank you guys!) but want to calibrate it.

My own is (biased ofc + couldn't sort):  
1. Airflow (dagster or similar, airflow just preferable in my country; tool of orchestration, it's clear)  
2. Postgres (relational db, very widespread, also no comment)

19dt9fn,How to model and save these two data source.,"In a manufactoring project I have two sensors:

1. Sensor 1: temperature data sampled at 10Hz continously.
2. Sensor 2: 3-axis accelerometer data sampled at 6kHz in a window of 10s every 10m. In other words, every 10m I have a windows of 10s containing 10\*6k=60000 records. Every record has a timestamp, a value for axis x, y, and z. 60000x4 table.

On sensors 2 data:

The ideas is to perform, at some stage, a ""data engineering"" phase where the ""raw data"" from sensors 2 mentionted before are processed in order to output some informative and less-dimensional data. For instance, letting the inputs be:

* Window 1 of 10s, sampled at 6kHz, every 10m has 60000x4 data (timestamp, x, y, z).
* Window 2 of 10s, sampled at 6kHz, every 10m has 60000x4 data (timestamp, x, y, z).
* ...
* Window M: ...

The output would be:

* MxN table/matrix (windows\_id, timestamp\_start\_window, feature1, feature2, ..., feature N-2).

Where N is the number of synthetic features created (e.g. mean x, median y, max z, min z, etc..) plus a timestamp (for instance the start of the window) and the windows ID and M is the number of windows.

If I want to save these two data raw sources (inputs) into a file system or database, and also the synthetic data (outputs), how would you save them in order to be flexible and efficient with later data analysis? The analysis will be based on time-series algorithm in order to dedect patterns and anomaly detections.

Note, the two sensors are an example of different sources with different requirements but the use case is not ""that simple"". I would like to discuss the design of modeling and storing/extraction of these time-series with easiness, scaling, and efficiency in mind.

19dtj92,Does AGPLv3 in an upstream system affect licensing of data analytics code?,"  

Hello!

My question is about AGPLv3 open-source licensing as it concerns BI code that works “downstream” of the open source system. I'm hoping that others in this r/ will have had experience with this and be willing to share.

I’m in charge of building a CRM and the corresponding BI platform that reads information that was entered into the CRM. The data platform is envisioned as a simple use of a business intelligence tool, running queries against the relational database that the CRM uses. 

Our goal is to use the CRM/BI combination internally for a few years, then market the whole solution as a product once it’s mature. I think that using an open-source CRM could readily meet the company’s needs while we develop the BI part as proprietary software. But there is the issue of creating a product from it later…

My concern is whether using an AGPLv3 licensed CRM for this interim period will require that I license the BI platform queries and data infrastructure as AGPLv3 as well. I am currently thinking that we’d have to share the BI queries/code because of the CRM’s licensing.

The CRM comes with a core database schema, but it also defines the database schema in response to user inputs (e.g., give an account a FK relationship to some other entity we also defined in the CRM’s GUI, etc.). The fact that the CRM’s database’s core schema represents a creative effort of its own -- and is not merely output from the program like the user-defined schemas are -- makes me think we run afoul of creating a derivative work here. And, with the CRM being AGPLv3, network use is distribution, so we’d have to share everything.

So, is that true?

I understand the wording of the AGPLv3 mentions pipes and other common inter-process communication techniques as not constituting a derivative work, but I do not know where the line is as regards database schema, as described here.

I’m hoping someone will be able to give some clarity. Thanks!",1,0,InternationalTea5284,2024-01-23 17:22:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19dtj92/does_agplv3_in_an_upstream_system_affect/,1.0,False,False,False,False

19dojoh,How to manage drift between dbt and Redshift,"Hello !

I am managing a team of 5 data engineers for the analytics of a retail compagnie and we use dbt and Redshift. The team is 5 years old and we have an accumulation of old databases that were not removed + manual changed that were made through the console and are not under control.  
I have been searching but didn't find good tools to monitor it (would love to get something that points the differences between dbt and the real state of snowflake).

19dega8,Using Airflow to execute preprocessing data for machine learning,"Hi guys, I began using Airflow recently. I am using it for my process server which user can import their file to data lake. Then I will pass these file location, ways to process and processed file destination to **Airflow** webserver throught API. **CeleryExecutor** then will add job to **rabbitMQ** and **workers** will execute that **DAG**. **DAG** contain 3 task: **Extract** (download data from data lake and read it as dataframe), **Transform** (perform some transformation to that df) and **Load** (load processed df back to data lake). My question is Is it common to reload data from data lake every time a dag is executed. I mean if user want to perform many process separately, then workers will have to reload data to RAM over and over again. Is there any way to optimize this or is there any better way to do this?

19e1jv5,How much does your data team rely on SaaS products?,"There is a massive growth in SaaS data tools, and I was wondering how much people rely on such product. Excluding cloud data warehouses (Snowflake/Redshift/Data bricks).

How much does your company rely on Salas tools for orchestration, data quality, data catalogs, ingestion, transformation? How big is your data team and your company's revenue? 

Which products do you use as Salas and which do you self-host? Why? 

What are the pros and cons of each?",0,1,exact-approximate,2024-01-23 22:51:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19e1jv5/how_much_does_your_data_team_rely_on_saas_products/,0.5,False,False,False,False

19dmods,How to handle one to many relationships in tables in a dashboard?,"Like for example, you have two tables - Orders and products. 
Orders table contains - user_id, product_id, num_orders, and 
Products table contains - product_id, product_category. 

Now, one product can belong to multiple categories. So one entry in order table might get mapped to multiple entries in products table which leads to data duplicity. Like, total orders per category or per user might be misleading.

What are the ways to handle this?",0,10,divyaanshDev,2024-01-23 11:49:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19dmods/how_to_handle_one_to_many_relationships_in_tables/,0.17,False,False,False,False
